# Security Policy

Please note, I maintain this project because I enjoy making stuff
and will continue to do so as long as this enjoyment lasts.

That being said, I will fix bugs and vulnerabilities as I have
time for it. If my work rate is not to your satisfaction feel
free to incentivize me with monetary compensation, help fix 
the issue, or write your own software :)
